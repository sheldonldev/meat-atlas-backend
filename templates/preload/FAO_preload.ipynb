       " 'DatasetDescription': \"TheFAOSTAT Macro Indicatorsdatabase provides a selection of country-level macroeconomic indicators relating to total economy (TE); agriculture (Ag); agriculture, forestry and fishing (AFF); manufacturing (MAN); manufacturing of food products and beverages (FB); manufacturing of tobacco products (Tob); and manufacturing of food, beverage and tobacco products (FBT). It releases time series for a selection of National Accounts variables, including gross domestic product, gross fixed capital formation, industry-level value added and gross output. The database also proposes additional indicators such as per capita GDP, year-on-year growth rates and measures ofindustry contribution to GDP.  All data relating to TE, AFF, and to MAN originates from the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) National Accounts Estimates of Main Aggregates database, which consists of a complete and consistent set of time series of the main National Accounts (NA) aggregates of all UN Members States and other territories in the world for which National Accounts information is available. The UNSD database's content is based on the countries' official NA data reported to UNSD through the annual National Accounts Questionnaire, supplemented with data estimates for any years and countries with incomplete or inconsistent information (Seehttp://unstats.un.org/unsd/snaama/Introduction.asp).  Series relating to the sub-industry Ag are obtained from the OECD Annual National Accounts and UNSD NA Official Country Data databases while serieson the FBT industry originates - in order of priority - from OECD Annual National Accounts and UNIDO INDSTAT2 databases. In order to ensure that sub-industry series are consistent in levels with National Accounts based series, which is needed to support comparability across industries (agriculture vs. agro-industry and sub-industries), we proceed to a rescaling exercise of UNIDO originating series on UNSD National Accounts Estimates of Main Aggregates data series (See Section 20 for a more detailed description of the data processing steps)\",\n",
